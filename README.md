An MMORPG! A Legendairy Story. 


##Introduction
Welcome to the world of Legendairy. This turn based RPG takes you through various randomly generated dungeons, in which you will have to fend off baddies and solve challenging puzzles! You will be given a huge range of customization, ranging from vocations and elemental alignments to strongest and weakest assets, totalling in 168 different possible characters to make! Can you make it through 6 bosses and face the evil dark lord himself? Start an adventure and see if you have what it takes to be Legendairy!

##Instructions
Playing Legendairy is relatively simple. When you are prompted for a response, entering the correct response (Caps and spelling matter) will allow the player to perform a certain action such as casting a spell or using an item. Sometimes, you will need to enter any character to continue the game. Typing incorrect responses may result in some free hits by the monsters, so watch out! 

##Technical Stuff
Our project solidifies and showcases the usage of Java class hierarchy and interfaces. We will be using abstract classes and interfaces. We will also use some Java 7 API classes such as Scanner, HashMap, and ArrayList. We also used the Java file I/O (with util.Writer and util.Scanner) and enumerations.
