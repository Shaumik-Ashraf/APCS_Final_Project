##TODO

- Complete interfaces (water, wood, sky)
- Complete other classes (Mage, Archer)
- Add items


##Description
We want to create a turn based RPG. At the very least, the game will be able to do this: the user creates a character with a special class and element. The character will start in a common hub, where the user can go down a path of fields (featuring monsters, who have their own elements) or towns (featuring healing). We want to implement features such as elemental weaknesses and exp into our battle system as well as strongest/weakest stat for better player cutomization. 

Our project will solidify and showcase the usage of Java class hierarchy and interfaces. We will be using abstract classes and interfaces. We will also use some Java 7 API classes such as Scanner and ArrayList. We may stretch out to Java file I/O (with util.Writer and util.Scanner) and enumerations.
